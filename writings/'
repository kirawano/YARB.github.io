	<i>i swear these will be more frequent i just kind of accidentally wasted the entire month of July</i>

	<p>I don't want to waste too much time writing an intro for this one; if you've clicked on this blog you've probably already heard of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfdeWd0RMk&pp=ygUYYSBqb2tlIGFib3V0IG1lYXN1cmVtZW50">Jan Misali's <i>a joke about measurement</i></a>, which covers a lot of the introductory stuff regarding what coherence is and constructing coherent systems of units. If you have any questions about the blog, I'm just going to redirect you there.</p>

	<i>not going to be offering imperial conversions, those are lame</i>

	<h2>Methods</h2>
	<p>So, I'm going to test if a system is coherent by seeing if I can convert the given set of units into any <math>(m,l,t)</math> set of units (mass, length, time), mainly because I know that SI units are coherent. I'm also probably just going to add in the more niche units of measurement (like the coulomb and moreso the candela) despite the fact that some of these unit systems are made to fit an aesthetic. Unless it's important to the specific case, I'm going to leave out those niche units that are required for a wholly coherent system, but just assume they're there pl0x.

	<h2>The <i style="color:cyan">WET:</i> Water Units</h2>

	<p>These units are an original creation based off various properties of water. It's also comically large to the extend that the unit of energy (which I've labelled the <i style="color:cyan">dam</i>) is more than the annual energy consupmtion of the United States. Let's get into it.</p>
